# Etch-a-Sketch

A simple project to generate grid of squares.

The project requires the user to enter a number which is taken in as the grid square size to generate the grid of squares. i.e if the user enters 43, a 43 by 43 grid of squares would be generated.
Also, a random color is generated if the user hover over each square grid.

## From this project,I have learnt the following concepts:

- css variables
- dealing with various events
- the setProperty method
- generate random colors
- creating and working with classes in js
- nested for loops

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT

## Live Demo
